# Task 2 â€“ Tic Tac Toe (Human vs AI)

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where a human player competes against an AI opponent using the **Minimax algorithm**.

Developed as Task 2 during the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Internship at CodSoft.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the use of game theory and decision-making algorithms in artificial intelligence. The AI makes optimal moves by evaluating all possible future game states using the Minimax strategy.

## Features

- Two-player mode: Human vs AI
- AI uses Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves
- Input validation and clear game display
- Detects win, loss, or draw scenarios
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Algorithm: Minimax

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed.  
To play the game, run the script using the command:
python Tic-tac-toe.py
